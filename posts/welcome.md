# Welcome!

Welcome to the Task Exploration Activity for hate speech detection! In this series of modules, you'll learn about the history of hate speech detection as a task in the larger pipeline of automatic content moderation (ACM). You'll also be able to interact with and compare datasets and models built for this task. 

The goal of this exploration is to share the design considerations and challenges faced when using algorithms to detect hate speech.
